# Decoder investigation notes

## JPEG standalone restart markers — 2026-09-24

[PROVEN] `jpeg::writer::write_jpeg` omitted RST0–RST7 entries from JBRD
`marker_order`. These are standalone markers, including a restart after the
last MCU; restart markers inside scans are reconstructed separately in
`write_sos`. libjxl v0.12 `lib/jxl/jpeg/dec_jpeg_data_writer.cc::EncodeRestart`
writes the standalone marker's two bytes without deriving a new restart index.

`jpeg::writer::tests::standalone_restart_markers_keep_original_order` failed
before the correction: only SOI, EOI and trailing data survived. It covers all
eight marker values in a deliberately nonsequential order. The matching encoder
scanner correction is jxl-encoder `1a40b8f3`; its conformance harness at
`a6a9a116` records 21 camera originals reconstructing two bytes short before
this writer fix, and validates reconstruction with both Rust and libjxl v0.12.
No public API or scan-entropy algorithm changes are required.

Validation: release library tests with `jpeg` pass under CI's explicit
`ZENJXL_ALLOW_MISSING_CORPUS=1` configuration (834 reported passes, 28 existing
ignores). Of those reported passes, 103 corpus-backed feature cases do not run
because the Mac lacks their corpus; the unconfigured run fails those 103 cases
and passes the other 731. All eight JPEG reconstruction tests and the new
standalone-marker regression execute and pass. Logs are under
`~/tmp/jxl-backlog/decoder120-*` and `~/tmp/zenjxl-decoder/jpeg-issue120.log`.
`just jpeg-reconstruction-check <label>` reproduces the release library gate;
set the corpus policy explicitly at invocation, as CI does.
Workspace all-target, all-feature Clippy and scoped formatting also pass.
